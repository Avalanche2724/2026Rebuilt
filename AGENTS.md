Build: ./gradlew build
For any Gradle action, use WPILib JDK: `JAVA_HOME=~/wpilib/2026/jdk`
After each action, create a git commit.
All commit messages generated by Codex must start with `(codex)`.

Code Guidelines
- Keep the code organized (clear package structure; avoid dumping logic into `Robot`).
- Constants at top of file with `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`.
- Avoid magic numbers; use named constants (include units in names, e.g. `MAX_VELOCITY_MPS`); avoid manual unit conversions, use WPILib units (e.g. `RotationsPerSecond.convertFrom(value, RadiansPerSecond)`) and static import any WPILib units used.
- Prefer immutable where reasonable (`final` fields ok); do not mark locals `final`; for non-primitive locals prefer `var`; minimize global/static state.
- Keep robot loop code non-blocking (no `Thread.sleep`, no long I/O in `periodic`/command `execute`).
- Prefer command factory methods (e.g. `Commands.*`) over explicit command classes.
- Comments should explain "why" and constraints; avoid narrating obvious code.
- Build before commit: `./gradlew build` (build runs formatting via Spotless).

Sources (vendor + WPILib)
- Use WPILib JDK to avoid Gradle errors: `JAVA_HOME=~/wpilib/2026/jdk`.
- Download all Java sources jars with Gradle: `./gradlew downloadSources`.
- Unpack sources into `build/sources/` for fast searching: `./gradlew syncSources`.
- Vendor libraries:
  - Vendordep definitions live in `vendordeps/*.json` (Maven URLs + artifacts).
  - Sources jars land in `~/.gradle/caches/modules-2/files-2.1/<group>/<artifact>/<version>/`.
  - Inspect by searching `build/sources/` with `rg -n`, or with `jar tf <sources.jar>` / `unzip -q <sources.jar> -d /tmp/<dir>`.
- WPILib:
  - WPILib sources jars are also in `~/.gradle/caches/modules-2/files-2.1/edu.wpi.first/`.
  - Inspect by searching `build/sources/edu.wpi.first.*` with `rg -n`, or by unzipping jars from the cache.
